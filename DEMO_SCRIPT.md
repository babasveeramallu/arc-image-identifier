# Arc - Demo Video Script (3-5 minutes)

## 🎬 Scene 1: Introduction (30 seconds)
**[Show web interface]**
- "Hi! This is Arc - an AI-powered wall scanner that creates 3D room models in real-time"
- "Built for the hackathon challenge - it uses your smartphone camera to scan walls and detect elements like outlets and switches"
- "Let me show you how it works"

## 🎬 Scene 2: Real-time Scanning (90 seconds)
**[Start camera, point at wall]**
- "First, I'll start the camera and point it at this wall"
- **[Show live detection boxes appearing]**
- "You can see it's detecting wall elements in real-time - there's an outlet, a light switch"
- "The colored overlay shows the depth map - this is how it understands the 3D structure"
- **[Capture first wall]**
- "I'll capture this wall by clicking 'Capture Wall'"
- **[Move to second wall]**
- "Now I'll scan an adjacent wall to show the multi-wall stitching"
- **[Show different angle, capture second wall]**
- "The system automatically registers the spatial relationship between walls"

## 🎬 Scene 3: 3D Model Generation (60 seconds)
**[Click Generate Room]**
- "Now I'll generate the complete 3D room model"
- **[Show processing, then 3D viewer]**
- "Here's the reconstructed room! You can see both walls stitched together"
- "The detected elements are positioned accurately in 3D space"
- **[Rotate 3D model]**
- "I can rotate and examine the model from different angles"

## 🎬 Scene 4: Texture Application (45 seconds)
**[Show texture picker]**
- "One of the key requirements was texture application"
- **[Click different textures]**
- "I can apply different materials - white paint, brick, wood, concrete"
- **[Show texture changes in real-time]**
- "This helps visualize different finishes and materials"
- "Perfect for interior design and renovation planning"

## 🎬 Scene 5: Export & Conclusion (15 seconds)
**[Download model]**
- "Finally, I can export the 3D model as a PLY file"
- **[Show download]**
- "This file can be opened in any 3D software like Blender or used for further processing"
- "Arc successfully meets all hackathon requirements - real-time scanning, element detection, multi-wall stitching, and texture application"

## 📋 Demo Checklist
- [ ] Web interface loaded (localhost:8000)
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] Good lighting for wall scanning
- [ ] Wall with visible outlets/switches
- [ ] Second wall for stitching demo
- [ ] Screen recording software ready
- [ ] Audio recording clear

## 🎯 Key Points to Highlight
1. **Real-time processing** - Live camera feed with instant detection
2. **AI element detection** - Outlets, switches automatically identified
3. **3D reconstruction** - Depth estimation and point cloud generation
4. **Multi-wall stitching** - Automatic spatial relationship detection
5. **Texture system** - Material library with real-time preview
6. **Export capability** - Downloadable 3D models

## 📱 Technical Demo Flow
```
Camera Access → Live Detection → Wall Capture → 3D Generation → Texture Apply → Export
```

## 🎥 Recording Tips
- Use 1080p resolution minimum
- Ensure good lighting
- Keep camera steady during scanning
- Show UI elements clearly
- Speak clearly and at moderate pace
- Keep total length 3-5 minutes
- Add captions if needed
